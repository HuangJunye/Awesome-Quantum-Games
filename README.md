# Awesome Quantum Games

This list is inspired by [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme), but not intended to be awesome, but trying to be as complete as possible. 

## What are quantum games?

The definition of quantum games for this list is rather broad. Any game that have major component of quantum mechanics is a quantum game.

The games are listed in choronological order but not strictly. (Games listed under the same year but above are not necesarily released earlier than the games listed below.)
